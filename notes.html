Requirements

Functional requirements:

Dynamically fetch story data and populate it in a webpage via the Top Stories API based a user’s selection from a <select> field
Resize the header area (i.e. logo plus <select>) so that it transitions from occupying the entire screen on page load to only auto height after the <select> field is changed (you will need jQuery for this)
Link each returned image to its URL on the NYT website
General requirements:

Your project must:

Contain a single .html file and an external, minified .css file
Adequately reflect the designer’s vision for the website when built out using HTML and CSS
Demonstrate effective organization of the project’s root directory
Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory with an appropriately customized .gitignore file
Be pushed to GitHub (with all of your commits synced to it)
Contain a README.md file describing the project (e.g. technologies used, personal learnings, etc.)
Use Gulp for running build tasks, such as minification, Sass compilation, and error checking

CSS/Sass requirements:

Your project must:

Make appropriate use of classes and IDs as selectors
Use Sass as a preprocessor, with CSS properly compiled and minified
Use the background property where appropriate
Implement a mobile-first responsive layout using flexbox (no floats)
Demonstrate effective use of box model properties - padding, margin, height, width
Demonstrate effective use of CSS properties for altering the visual display of text (e.g. font-family, font-style, text-transform, etc.)
Incorporate custom fonts using @font-face
JS requirements:

Your project must:

Use Ajax to fetch data from the NYT Top Stories endpoint
Only display a maximum of 12 stories in the grid, and only display a story if it has a photo associated with it
Transition users between UI states, starting where no stories have been returned, and then subsequently transitioning where stories populate the grid (by incorporating a loading gif)
RWD requirements:

Your project must:

Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach
Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 600px, and min-width: 1000px
Additional requirements:

Be sure to test your project completely in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE11/Edge) when you think you’re finished
Stretch goals:

Want to challenge yourself? Your project could also:

Incorporate a <select> field with custom styles applied (you will need a jQuery plugin for this such as Selectric)
Incorporate a combination of jQuery and CSS3-based animation to animate the movement of the header on the <select> change
Use CSS3 transitions to show and hide the article abstract on hover

JQUERY NOTES

html: <p id="message">Welcome to Spots!</p>
js: document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = 'We love dogs!';
putting it in a variable:
var el = document.getElementById('message');
el.innerHTML = 'We love dogs!';
el.className = 'red'; // adds class name of "red" to the element

var el = document.getElementById('message');
el.innerHTML = 'We love dogs!';
el.className = 'red'; // adds class name of "red" to the element

 <p class="intro">Welcome to my page!</p>
To target this in jquery: $('.intro')
to change the color using css: $('.intro').css('color', 'red');

to store in a variable: var $intro = $('.intro');
$intro.css('color', 'red');
$intro.addClass('greeting');

need to add this to connect to the DOM:
$(document).ready(function() {
   // your jQuery code here...
});
// Or more commonly, you'll see the shorthand version:
$(function() {
   // your jQuery code here...
});

We can use the .prepend(), .append(), and .remove() methods to update content:
// Add new a new item to the end of the list:
var newContent = '<li>three</li>';
$('.numbers').append(newContent);
// Change the content of the second list item:
$('.numbers li:nth-child(2)').text('2');
// Remove the first item from the list:
$('.numbers').children(':first').remove();

Note that .prepend() and .append() will add content inside the element's opening and closing tags respectively.

The .before() and .after() methods will add content just before or just after the selected element.

s we have seen, it's very easy to add classes to elements with jQuery using .addClass():

$('ul').addClass('menu');
And we can similarly remove them with .removeClass():

$('ul').removeClass('menu');

We can also target other element attributes using the .attr() and .prop() methods:

$('li').attr('id', 'active');
$('input').prop('disabled', true)
Ostensibly, .attr() and .prop() do very similar things, but .prop() offers a slightly more modern, semantic approach and allows you to work with element attributes that are booleans, like the example above.

.always(function(){

}))
